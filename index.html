      <h3>Skill and Expertise</h3>
      <p>I'm currently building my skills in computer science.So here are some of the skill im working on at the moment: </p>
      
      <h4>Programming Languages:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> <b>C++:</b> and as a beginner, I'm learning the basics of C++ and working on small
           projects to apply what I've learned.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Web Development:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> <b>HTML/CSS:</b>I'm still learning how to create and style web pages.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Soft Skills:</h4>
        <p>While I'm still early in my journey, I've been working on developing several essential soft 
          skills that are important in both academic and professional settings:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <b>Problem-solving:</b> I enjoy tackling challenges and finding effective solutions, 
          whether it's debugging code or figuring out a tricky concept.</li>
        <li> <b>Time Management:</b>Balancing my studies, projects, and personal interests helps me stay organized and productive. </li>
        <li> <b>Creativity:</b>laying games and doing art helps me think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions. </li>
        <p>These skills are a work in progress, and I'm excited to keep developing them as I continue my journey in computer science.</p>

        <ol>
          <b><li>Simple Reading List in C++:</li></b>
            <p>This is my first project in C++, it is a simple program where you can input the list of the novels/manwha/manga that you are going to read or have read. It is helpful because you can tract down the status of what you are reading. Here's an image of the program: </p>
